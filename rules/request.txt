i have here a setup for a definition:

twinscrew simulation
carrea
A=15000 Pas
B=1.0 1/s
C=0.5

tbts
Tb=100C
Ts=-50C

customer wants particle tracing and heat simulation to be used. barrel is 150C
througput is 50 kg/h

wall slip :: yes

rho 980kg/m3

inflow material 140C

non-identical screws, angular shift 60deg

screw diameter 55mm
screw length 180mm
screwscrew gap 1mm
screwbarrel gap 1.5mm
barrel diameter 5.7cm
centerline distance 3cm


summary should be created, a validation of the available parametrs should be checked and the quantities for which a descriptive computation is addressed in the rules, should be computed. in case that some parameters are provided in other units then indicated in the rules please convert them into the defined units
